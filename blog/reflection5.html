        <h1>Reflection 5</h1>
        <p class="reflection">
            Whoops. I missed the deadline for two of my assignments these last two weeks.
            I felt really demotivated because my original idea for the AI Nittany Challenge
            was too difficult to implement even though I just said I was cautiously optimistic
            about it in my last reflection. I speedran another idea that I thought would be
            easier to implement. Nope. Google has already been working on both of those ideas.
            They completely mog me. So, I ended up back at the drawing board two separate times.
            I even asked Dr. Fusco about potentially getting an extension though I didn't phrase
            it that way. Week 4's assignment is gonna be a big fat 0. I have to cope and say there
            was no helping it, but in reality, I was also being really lazy and procrastinated a lot, so 
            I cannot entirely blame my missing the assignment deadline on changing ideas. I did end up
            submitting Week 5's assignment late, but at least I got it in. Third time's the charm, right?
            I guess you could say I am cautiously cautiously optimistic about this proposition. If you're curious
            about it, you can read all about it in my Week 5 assignment submission. At least, I am no longer
            thinking about late dropping this class. Imagine late dropping an elective. Ha! Couldn't be me!
        </p>
        <p class="reflection">
            Oh yeah, this is the week 5 reflection, so there weren't any lectures. I did spend a lot of time
            discussing my ideas with other people though I wouldn't consider those talks interviews. I had
            way too much input in those discussions; there were not even remotely close to 80/20 split in
            terms of who was doing the talking versus listening. The interviews were done in week 6, hence why the
            assignment was turned in late. I wrote extensively about the interview process and my thoughts
            on it in assignment 5, but I guess I can give some of the highlights. I was honestly surprised by how
            valuable the input was. Even just in short discussions, I was able to reframe my entire perspective on
            this AI challenge and on AI products as a whole. Maybe I'm overselling it or maybe I'm just deluding
            myself, but yeah, interviews are pretty important after all. They're still a major pain in the butt
            though. I would prefer outsourcing the interviews to someone else if I could.

        <p class="reflection">
            My biggest hardship this week was obviously missing the assignment deadline. It really sucked and
            brought back some unpleasant memories. Old habits die hard, and changing is even harder. I don't
            know why I'm getting so personal in these reflections. TMI! Here's hoping I get my semester back on track
            this week and stopping submitting my assignments late or not at all. I guess there was some added pressure
            from internship applications. I know it was just two assignments. I could probably still pass this Course
            with an A minus if I locked in. I know I'm too hard on myself sometimes too. C'est la vie.

        <p class="reflection">
            This week, I used Copilot to autocomplete some of the text for this reflection. I didn't switch back to
            Cursor yet because I have been slacking on updating my website. It still looks terrible. Copilot is still trash
            at autocompleting HTML tags, and the text it produces sounds like a high schooler trying to meet a word count,
            truly awful AI slop garbage. Sorry if this reflection was overly negative, but at least I'm being transparent.
            Maybe it borders on satire, and you can read between the lines to see the humor in it. I don't know. Thanks
            for being patient with me. That's all for this week. I'm about to go write my week 6 reflection now.
