        <h1>Reflection 3</h1>
        <p class="reflection">
            I enjoyed the lectures this week. Using AI effectively will become rather important in the next few years,
            particularly for students and programmers. It should be a mandatory course for highschoolers and undergraduates.
            In order to get an edge over your peers, you leverage the tools you have available to you, 
            tragedy of the commons and all that. I do find it funny that we call it "prompt engineering"
            though. There is no "engineering" involved in it; it is a misnomer. You could even outsource
            the chore of writing effective prompts to AI itself, specifically for roleplay and one-offs.
            The AI can prompt itself to prompt itself. I think people call this "meta prompting."
        </p>
        <p class ="reflection">
            From my perspective, AI will be the most transformative technology of the decade.
            As students graduating and entering the workforce at this inflection point of human history,
            understanding this nascent technology will be imperative to success. That is what I believe.
            This is doubly true for a Computer Science major such as myself. Learning how to prompt AI
            aligns with this view.

            My hardship this week was time management. I felt that I had to keep busy everyday
            in order to make the deadlines for my classes. It did not help that I took on more responsibility
            this week, working at the campus garden and as a peer tutor. I'm not built like some of these
            other undergrads who juggle a part time job with a full course load. I was able to work through it
            by assigning an order of precedence to my tasks for each day. I don't know if I will be able to
            sustain this long term, especially since I am considering participating in the LionLink Projects.
            I guess we will see.
        </p>
        <p class="reflection">
            This week, I used Cursor autocomplete to help write parts of my written reflection
            and to code the new webpage for reflection 3. I also used Gemini to look up the technical
            term for this recursive prompting I mentioned previously.
            Oh yeah. I think a better name for "prompt engineering" would be "strategic prompting" or
            maybe "systematic prompting." Just spitballing here.
