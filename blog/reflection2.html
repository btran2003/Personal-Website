        <h1>Reflection 2</h1>
        <p class="reflection">
            Two weeks done. The lectures this week were rather informative.
            The professor emphasized the logistical and ethical side of the Nittany
            AI Challenge. He covered specifically what kind of team structure is conducive
            to success, which I found very informative even if I, personally, am more likely
            to try and do a bit of everything. With "no-code" or "vibe-coding",
            you feel kind of helpless not knowing how anything works. I appreciated
            the ethical considerations Professor Fusco mentioned. I feel as if that is something
            sorely missing in the AI discourse happening online these days.
        </p>
        <p class="reflection">
            The conversation about ethical AI or AI for good resonated with me.
            Anecdotally, I find that I am motivated more by moral conviction than by economic gain.
            It is something I think that everybody should try to model their lives after even if
            I struggle with putting it into practice. If I had any grand ambition or aspirations,
            It would certainly involve enacting some positive social or societal changes.
            Maybe it sounds cliche or juvenile, I feel like most adults also share this oxymoronic
            selfish desire to change the world.
        </p>
        <p class="reflection">
            The main challenge I encountered this week was my own dwindling motivation and enthusiasm.
            I think it is natural to feel that way after a hectic first week of the semester.
            I constantly have to remind myself to pace myself, so that I do not burn out.
            The way I worked through it was by spending more time for myself. I spent much of the week
            pursuing hobbies rather than studying. I do not know if it is sustainable long term.
            I really need to learn to manage my time better though.
        </p>
        <p class="reflection">
            I used ChatGPT and cursor this week as I continued working on my website.
            It is no longer a plain hypertext webpage. WE'RE IN COLOR! 
            I also added some back-end stuff that you can't see. You can see that on my github repo.
            I heard that Claude is a particularly good LLM for programming, 
            so I experimented with that a bit. I think I might incorporate it into
            my workflow and make it my main chat bot. We'll see. In a way, these weekly reflection are also a
            log of my website development. That's all from me this week ðŸ«¡.
