        <h1>Reflection 4</h1>
        <p class="reflection">
            The lectures this week were fun. I particularly enjoyed the particpation
            activities. Receiving positive feedback on my ideas felt rewarding, and
            seeing other peoples' ideas was helpful as well. I gained some new projects ideas
            to develop in my free time if I ever get around to it. I wasn't aware of all of the
            options that were out there for web development and the various APIs that other people
            developed using AI technology. Having access to those APIs makes any future
            AI product more feasible and easy to implement with a bit of fine tuning.
            It really got me thinking how little individuals can accomplish on their own.
            Newton's quote about standing on the shoulders of giants comes to mind.

            This week's content related to my goals in that it really helped with the design
            and planning phase of the AI nittany challenge product idea. I've never had to
            even think about these aspects of product development before. I could really
            use any help I can get.

            This week was pretty rough. It was likely the most discouraging week of the semester so far.
            My main hardship was that dang weekly assignment due on Sunday from the previous week. I had been putting it
            off for a while because I felt that my original AI idea was too difficult to implement and infeasible
            for a team of students. I didn't want to waste the time and effort doing these early stages of
            product development for an idea I wasn't even going to do. That is mainly why I put it off
            for so long and tanked the graded for the assignment. I couldn't think of any other idea that 
            I was particularly excited about or thought would have a chance of winning. I felt myself
            teetering on the edge of the wagon, so I said screw it and went back to my old idea.
            Now though, having done the value proposition idea, I am now cautiously optimistic about
            my product idea. It will certainly be very difficult to execute, but it has the potential
            to become something worthwhile. I'm recruiting team members currently. Two people might not
            be enough.
        </p>

            This week, I used ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok for Weekly Assignment 3. I used Copilot
            to help me code the new webpage for reflection 4 and to autocomplete some of the text
            for this reflection. I have to say the text prediction and tab completion for VSCode are pretty terrible.
            I might have to move back to cursor even though they limit the number of tabs you get. It never
            adds the closing tag for HTML elements, which can be rather frustrating. Oh well. I just hope that my
            tanking my grade for a better product idea pays off in the end.
