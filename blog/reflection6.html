        <h1>Reflection 6</h1>
        <p class="reflection">
            The lectures were short this week. There are only so many AI tools out there 
            for Professor Fusco to talk about. I also noticed that there were
            fewer students in the zoom call than previously. I suppose we've reached the point in the
            semester where people have decided that it is not worth sitting through the lectures
            especially since, to my knowledge, Professor Fusco doesn't take attendance.
            Or maybe I am being too cynical, and many students had other stuff going on this week.
            There were no participation activities during the lectures either. He did give some 
            useful tips on what to focus on for the protoype phase of our projects though. 
            The methodology and strategies for developing a successful application
            is not something that has been discussed much in my previous CS courses, so
            I appreciated the practical advice.

            This week's content related to my goals in that it is useful information
            to know when developing any type of product but especially an AI product.
            I have never thought about these aspects of product development before, and
            I would wager that neither have the majority of people who attempt AI startups.
            The barrier to entry for starting app development and starting a company is as low
            as its ever been; still, sticking to the fundamentals gives a significant advantage.

            My biggest hardship this week was the cascade of deadlines and assignments from
            previous weeks that I had been putting off crashing down on me. I had a presentation
            and two research assignments on top of my weekly assignments for this class. There is
            no point in complaining about that though since it was entirely self inflicted.
            I am still in the process of weathering that proverbial storm. Luckily, most of 
            those assignments were group work, so I can rely on my teammates to carry some of the load.

            As usual, I used Copilot to help me code the new webpage for reflection 6 and to autocomplete
            some of the text for this reflection. I used ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas for my weekly assignment
            and to help me write the value proposition for my AI product. It was business as usual.
