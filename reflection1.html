    <h1>Reflection 1</h1>
    <p class="reflection">
        Whew, what a week! I was putting it off, but I finally got a website up and running,
        just in time to submit my first weekly digital reflection. It's my first website!
        Designing a website is something I had been meaning to do since my freshman year at Penn State,
        but I kept pushing it back. It is crazy for someone majoring in Computer Science
        to have not had a website for so long, but I can finally check it off the list.
        Obviously, the form it exists in now is temporary. I'm planning on working on it
        over the course of the semester. Perhaps it would be satisfying for you to track my progress
        as you read each of my weekly reflections, just an idea.
    </p>
    <p class="reflection">
        Now onto the reflection. The first week of a semester is always stressful, but this time
        I felt oddly composed. I did have some trepidation about taking this course at first, and
        I didn't know what to expect. I did feel some relief and mild disappoint during our first
        lecture. I was relieved that there would be no pressure in taking this course, yet
        disappointed that we would not be covering the more technical aspect of AI. 
        The class did force me into a position where I had to stop putting off
        something I had been for a while. I enjoyed the activity during the second lecture, so many
        good ideas to steal for my AI start up. On a serious note, I really did enjoy seeing other
        people's ideas. It was nice feeling reading the shared enthusiasm we all had regarding this
        nascent technology. We really are on the precipice of a new world.
    </p>
    <p class="reflection">
        This week's content related to my goals insofar as I've been trying to come up
        with ideas for a startup for months now, ideally one I could work on together
        with my close friends. Discussing it in class made it seem all the more plausible.
        I've been hesitant to take a chance on myself and really apply myself, but with this
        AI challenge coming up, I have an opportunity. I don't want to get ahead of myself,
        but I feel like I've struck on a really good idea. Whether it is realistic or
        manageable for myself and my limited resources is yet to be seen.
    </p>
    <p class="reflection">
        The main difficulty I had encountered this week was getting this dang website up
        in the first place. I had dabbled in HTML and CSS before, but I had nearly forgotten
        everything by now. I worked through it slowly and painfully with the help of some
        assistants-- AI. While I am not writing this reflection using AI tools, I did use
        AI to help design this website, both to write some of the code and also for
        design ideas. I used specifically ChatGPT and Cursor for this project.
        AI had simplified and expedited the process so much that I had mixed feelings about it.
        An AI agent could have done the whole thing itself. What did it need me for right?
        Anyway, I am really looking forward to this semester. Things actually feel different
        this time.
